# Cat and Dog Classification Using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to develop a robust image classification model that can accurately distinguish between the two classes. This type of binary classification is a fundamental task in computer vision and serves as a great introduction to deep learning techniques using CNNs.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

* Built using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your framework).
* Preprocessed and augmented image dataset to improve model generalization.
* Achieved high accuracy on both training and validation datasets.
* Includes model evaluation with performance metrics.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy, Matplotlib

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, typically sourced from Kaggle or other open datasets. Images are resized and normalized as part of the preprocessing pipeline. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

The CNN architecture includes:

* Convolutional layers for feature extraction
* Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality
* Dense layers for classification
* Dropout for regularization

## âœ… Results

The model demonstrates strong performance in distinguishing between cats and dogs, with a validation accuracy of 92%. Visualizations of predictions and performance metrics are provided for better interpretability.
